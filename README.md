A Django based webapp that extracts Gmail threads of a Gmail Account using Gmail API and analyses the sentiments dipicted in the mailing threads using Vader Sentiment Analysis Tool. Note that, the Gmail API of the Gmail Account whose message threads are needed must be enabled.


For front end I used HTML-CSS, Bootstrap and javascript.
